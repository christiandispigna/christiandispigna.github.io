    I am working with Dr. Cetinkaya and his team of graduate students at the Photo-Acoustics Research Laboratory at Clarkson University this summer. I am using Optuna to optimize the hyperparameters of critical quality attribute extracting machine learning models in conjunction of ultrasonic sensors to improve the quality control on pharmaceutical tabletss. By improving the hyperparameters, I have minimized the computation power required while also keeping the error under the 2% error set by industry standards. I recently got the opportunity to present my work at Clarkson's RAPS showcase with a poster. Here is a brief video showcasing my work{% include youtube-video.html id="3d13rYmwAMU" autoplay= "false"%}
