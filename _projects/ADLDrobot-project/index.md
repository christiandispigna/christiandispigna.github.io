title: Advanced Digital Logic Design Robotics Competition (Completed)
description:   
    Using parts supplied by the professor, I manufactured, tested, and coded in Quartus a robot to complete an obstacle course in the shortest amount of time. This was done with a very limited CPLD, so optimizing the space was crucial. On competition day, my robot performed admirably, qualifying to the final round.
skills: 
  - Quartus
  - VHDL
  - Soldering
  - Manufacturing
  - Finite State Machine Optimization
